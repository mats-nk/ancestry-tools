The ancestry_refactor.py tool is a next step utility designed to take the Gedcom file used for the download and refactor it to clean things up and enhance it so that it can be imported into another genealogy program. In this case I use Gramps but it should work fine with others as well.

The following is a list of the things that are or can be done depending on the various command line options provided:

1. Replace all of the _APID references in the source citations with proper links to the downloaded media images if the record had an associated image. This can be done using a relative or absolute path reference to the image. (See -a flag) 

2. Add the links to the optional screenshots of the source citation record pages to the source citation records. (See -I flag)

3. Add missing or enhance the existing source citations. In some cases the source citation page shows the citation information but it may be missing in the Gedcom. In other cases if a birth, marriage, death or divorce fact is identifiable and a certificate or license number is provided and not part of the source citation it is appended. If a certificate or license number is provided and no citation exists at all one is generated using the information. (See -B flag)

4. Add all of the extracted facts related to the source citation to the citation notes so they are available for reference when imported else where. As with other things Ancestry does not include any of this information in their Gedcom export process. (See -F flag)

5. Save the URL to the source citation page in the source citation notes. (See -C flag)

6. Remove stray source records that are not used or referenced by any of the source citations. I found several of these in my tree and do not understand why they were there.

7. Add better publisher information to all the source records. Nearly every record from Ancestry.com has the publisher set to a vanilla "Ancestry.com Operations, Inc." But we have the extracted source information about the publisher, so we replace the generic boiler plate with that. An example being "Ancestry.com. London, England, Church of England Deaths and Burials, 1813-2003 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2010"

8. If found in the extract add information about the original data source that the database was created from as a source note.

9. If found, and almost every collection has it, save the source description for the database as a source note. Note sometimes the original data and the source description overlap but most of the time they do not.

10. Save the URL to the main database search page for the source as a source note. (See -S flag)

11. During the source citation extraction process an attempt is made to identify the URL to the person page in the tree. If the information is available the URL can be saved in the person notes. (See -P flag)

12. If requested use an external places file to perform some simple place name substitutions. For example I prefer to use "United States" and not USA or U.S.A or United States of America but I standardized on that some years after starting my tree. Note these substitutions are only applied to place names identified by the PLAC tag. Place names that occur in facts or notes are not touched. (See -p flag)

13. If requested try to cleanup the date format a little. In general this will try to remove leading 0's in numbers, add a space after the month but before the year if there was a typo, and expand three letter month abbreviations into full month names. This applies to any dates identified by the DATE tag but also to any of the extracted facts added to a source citation note if the word "Date" is found in the fact description. (See -d flag)

14. Proper @Mxxxxx@ media records are generated for every media item in the Gedcom and appended to the end of the Gedcom before the closing TRLR tag. All of the OBJE/FILE/FORM sequences in the Gedcom for the user media are replaced with the proper OBJE @Mxxxx@ pointer record and of course the pointer records are used for all the source citation links to images or screenshots.

The URL to the media page is kept as a media note along with the description if one was provided. The media type is added although I am unsure if any import programs support it.

15. Media images associated with the source citation records can also be linked to the actual source record. For common sources like censuses the source record can end up with dozens or hundreds of these.

16. Many other programs may not recognize the _APID tags, so these are stripped out by default. This can be overridden. (See -K flag)

A sample invocation of the utility might be as follows:

```
./ancestry_refactor.py -BCdDFPSo -p ./places.toml ancestry_gedcom.ged ./familytree ./familytree/refactored_gedcom.ged
```

This applies pretty much all the options to the downloaded ancestry_gedcom.ged using the extracted tree information under familytree and creates the new file in the familytree directory. This is convenient if you want to tar or zip everything up.
